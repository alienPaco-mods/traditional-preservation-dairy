# Changelog: Traditional Preservation (Dairy)

## 0.0.1 (in development, not released)
- Internal: made by `tp new` from the series template, with the shared core.
- Internal: the yoghurt rules. Scalded milk cools in the lidded clay pot by Newton's law towards the temperature
  where it stands, and topping up mixes temperatures. With a starter in, the pot is wrapped at 45 C. The milk sets
  at a speed that follows its own temperature. A starter won't take below 40 C, so cold milk has to be reheated.
  Collecting fills one Clay Jar per litre and carries the yoghurt's age. Batches under 2.5 L cool as if they were
  2.5 L, for balance.
- Internal: a Hearth place at 28 C, for a lit fireplace, antique oven, brazier, cooking pit or campfire within two
  tiles (never an electric or gas stove).
- Internal: the Starter Culture Crock's two weather-driven stages, with a feed of fresh milk between them.
- Internal: two weeks of hourly weather in global ModData, so an unloaded pot catches up hour by hour.
- Internal: sandbox options for the setting time, the culture time and temperature sensitivity.
- Internal: 44 tests, and a golden report of cooling and setting times by month and place.
- The Yoghurt Incubator has no window: its right-click menu shows what the pot is doing (hover for where it stands
  and the time to the next change), and offers Pour Hot Milk, Add Starter, Pour Out Milk and Collect into Clay Jar.
- Internal: the world code tracks each pot, records the hourly weather, catches the milk up and picks the stage
  sprite. The pot's state lives in movableData, so it can be picked up full. The skeleton's slots, placeholder items
  and Craft-button recipe are gone.
- Internal: debug console `TPD.help()`: weather, place, pots, skip, fast timer, hot milk, starter kit.
- Items: Yoghurt Pot (thrown at Pottery 2, fired in a kiln), Jar of Yoghurt, Active Yoghurt Starter, Empty Yoghurt
  Container. The incubator is built from a Yoghurt Pot, 2 Ripped Sheets and Twine (Pottery 2, Tailoring 1).
- Set yoghurt is collected into an empty Clay Jar, Glazed Clay Jar or glass canning jar, a litre each, and portioned
  into four vanilla Yoghurts with one Empty Yoghurt Container per cup. The same jar comes back, and the cups keep the
  yoghurt's age. A last jar under a litre gives fewer cups and hands back the spare containers.
- Every vanilla Yoghurt leaves an Empty Yoghurt Container when eaten or stirred into oatmeal.
- The Starter Culture Crock: built from a Clay Jar or a Clay Pot, a Ripped Sheet and Twine (Pottery 4, Cooking 4).
  Its right-click menu loads 20 wheat grains and half a litre of warm milk (35 C or more), feeds half a litre of
  fresh milk once cultivated, and collects 2 Active Yoghurt Starters. Its state lives in movableData.
- Internal: placeholder crock tiles (2 and 3) until the art; `TPD.crocks()`, `TPD.culture(hours)`, `TPD.crockkit()`;
  48 tests.
- Art: the Yoghurt Incubator and the Starter Culture Crock are painted clay pots that stand straight on the floor, so
  they can be set down by a fire. The incubator shows its lid on the floor (empty, ready), on the pot (cooling) or
  under a striped cloth tied at the neck (incubating), and the set yoghurt when ready. The crock, with a slip band of
  zig-zags, shows a linen cap (cultivating, waiting), milk and wheat (developing), and the culture (ready).
- Art: icons for the Yoghurt Pot (unfired and fired), Jar of Yoghurt, Active Yoghurt Starter and Empty Yoghurt
  Container, the two build icons and the mod icon. The 3D models are still vanilla stand-ins.
- Art: milk too cold for a starter shows the incubator's lid slid half off the pot with the milk showing, so it can be seen at a glance.
- Internal: `TPD.kit(kind)` gives the things a test needs (`yoghurt`, the default, or `crock`, which replaces
  `TPD.crockkit()`); `TPD.kit("?")` lists them. Each new dairy adds a kit.
- Not done yet: guide, README, Workshop text.
